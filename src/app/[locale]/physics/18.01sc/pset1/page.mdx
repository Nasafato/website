## Problem 1: Cyclist and car.

This is a straightforward kinematics problem. 

### Part A: Finding kinematic equations for the car

Take the integral of the acceleration to get the velocity.

$$
v_c = 
\begin{cases} 
v_0 & 0 < t < t_1 \\
v_0-c(\frac{1}{2}t^2 - t_1 t + \frac{1}{2}t_1^2) & t_1 < t < t_2 
\end{cases}
$$

And take the integral of the velocity to get the position.

$$
x_c = 
\begin{cases} 
v_0 t & 0 < t < t_1 \\
v_0 t -c(\frac{1}{6}t^3 - \frac{1}{2}t_1 t^2 + \frac{1}{2}t_1^2 t +\frac{1}{6}t_1^3)
 & t_1 < t < t_2 
\end{cases}
$$

### Part B: Find the speed of the bicycle
We know the car's velocity must become zero at $t_2$ which is exactly when the cyclist reaches the car,
which means we can find $t_2$.

We can find the cyclist's position as a function of time, which will have $v_b$ in it, and set it equal to the car's position at $t_2$ to find $v_b$.

First, the cyclist's position:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_b(t)&=x_b(0)+\int_{t'=0}^{t'=t} v_b dt' \\
x_b(t)&=-17 + v_b t
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, for $t_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_c(t_2) = 0 &= v_0-c(\frac{1}{2}t_2^2 - t_1 t_2 + \frac{1}{2}t_1^2)  \\
 &= -\frac{c}{2}t_2^2 + ct_1 t_2 - \frac{c}{2}t_1^2 + v_0 \\
 &= -3t_2^2 + 6t_2+9 \\
 &= (t_2-3)(-3t_2-3)
\end{aligned}
$$

So, we have $t_2=3$, ignoring the negative solution.

Now, plug this in to $x_c(t)$ (the car's position) to get the final position at which the bicycle and the car meet:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_c(t_2=3) &=26 = x_b(t_2=3) \\
26 &= -17 + 3v_b \\
v_b &= 13.67 m/s

\end{aligned}
$$
