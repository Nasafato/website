## Problem 1: Cyclist and car.

This is a straightforward kinematics problem. 

### Part A: Finding kinematic equations for the car

Take the integral of the acceleration to get the velocity.

$$
v_c = 
\begin{cases} 
v_0 & 0 < t < t_1 \\
v_0-\frac{1}{2}c(t - t_1)^2 & t_1 < t < t_2 
\end{cases}
$$

And take the integral of the velocity to get the position.

$$
x_c = 
\begin{cases} 
v_0 t & 0 < t < t_1 \\
v_0 t - \frac{1}{6}c(t - t_1)^3 & t_1 < t < t_2 
\end{cases}
$$

### Part B: Find the speed of the bicycle
We know the car's velocity must become zero at $t_2$ which is exactly when the cyclist reaches the car,
which means we can find $t_2$.

We can find the cyclist's position as a function of time, which will have $v_b$ in it, and set it equal to the car's position at $t_2$ to find $v_b$.

First, the cyclist's position:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_b(t)&=x_b(0)+\int_{t'=0}^{t'=t} v_b dt' \\
x_b(t)&=-17 + v_b t
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, for $t_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_c(t_2) &= v_0-\frac{1}{2}c(t_2-t_1)^2  = 0 \\
 &= (t_2-t_1)^2 = \frac{2v_0}{c}  \\

t_2 &= \sqrt{\frac{2v_0}{c}} + t_1

\end{aligned}
$$

So, we have $t_2=3$, ignoring the negative solution.

Now, plug this in to $x_c(t)$ (the car's position) to get the final position at which the bicycle and the car meet, which is $28$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_b(t_2=3) &= 28\\
-17 + 3v_b &= 28 \\
v_b &= 15

\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 2: Elevator Trip

Acceleration is the rate at which velocity increases, so the slopes of the trapezoid's left and right sides are $a$ and $-a$, respectively.
The height is $aT$, since after $T$ seconds, the elevator has reached its maximum velocity of $aT$.

The area of the trapezoid is the distance traveled, which can be computed as the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the rectangle.

This is equal to $\frac{1}{2}aT^2+\frac{1}{2}aT^2+4aT^2=5aT^2$.

In this time, the elevator travels a distance $h$, so we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5aT^2 &= h \\
a &= \frac{h}{5T^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 3: Rocket Launch

We can find the time at which the rocket reaches its maximum height by setting the velocity to zero and solving for $t$. To do this, we must derive the velocity equation.

To find $h$, we derive the position equations for the stone and the rocket and set them equal to each other, then solve for $h$.

### Rocket equations

We will ignore gravity for the rocket and use the acceleration equation as it is given to us.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_y(t)&=A-Bt \\
v_y(t)&=At-\frac{1}{2}Bt^2 \\
h_y(t)&=\frac{1}{2}At^2-\frac{1}{6}Bt^3
\end{aligned}
$$

Find $t_f$ such that $v_y(t_f)=0$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
At_f-\frac{1}{2}Bt_f^2 &= 0 \\
t_f(A-\frac{1}{2}Bt_f) &= 0 \\
t_f &= 0, \frac{2A}{B}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Ball equations

The acceleration equation for the ball is $a_y(t)=-g$, so we can integrate this to get the velocity and position equations.
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_b(t)&=-g \\
v_b(t)&=-gt \\
h_b(t)&=h-\frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### Finding $h$

We set the heights of the rocket and ball equal to each other at $t_f$ and solve for $h$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h_b(t_f) &= h_y(t_f) \\
h-\frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 &= \frac{1}{2}At_f^2-\frac{1}{6}Bt_f^3  \\
h &= \frac{1}{2}At_f^2-\frac{1}{6}Bt_f^3 + \frac{1}{2}gt_f^2  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the value of $t_f=\frac{2A}{B}$ we found earlier, we get:
$$
\begin{aligned}
h &= \frac{2A^3}{B^2} + \frac{4A^3}{3B^2} + \frac{2A^2g}{B^2} \\
&= \frac{2A^3}{3B^2} + \frac{2A^2g}{B^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 4: Throw and Catch

As before, we derive the kinematic equations for the ball and the person.

We are given the constraint that the ball is caught at the same height it was thrown from, which we set as $y=0$. Setting the ball's final position to $0$ and solving for $t_f$ gives us the time at which the ball is caught, which we can then use to find $B$ by using $t_f$ in the person's position equation.

### Ball equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{b,y}(t) &= -g \\
a_{b,x}(t) &= 0 \\
v_{b,y}(t) &= v_0\sin{\theta} -gt \\
v_{b,x}(t) &= v_0\cos{\theta} \\
p_{b,y}(t) &= v_0\sin{\theta}t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
p_{b,x}(t) &= -d + v_0\cos{\theta}t
\end{aligned}
$$

### Person equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{p,x}(t) &= Bt \\
v_{p,x}(t) &= \frac{1}{2}Bt^2 \\
p_{p,x}(t) &= \frac{1}{6}Bt^3
\end{aligned}
$$

### Solving for $t_f$
Setting $p_{b,y}(t_f)=0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_0\sin{\theta}t_f - \frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 &= 0 \\
t_f(v_0\sin{\theta} - \frac{1}{2}gt_f) &= 0 \\
t_f &= 0, \frac{2v_0\sin{\theta}}{g}

\end{aligned}
$$

### Solving for $B$
We set the x-positions of the ball and the person equal to each other at $t_f$ and solve for $B$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{b,x}(t_f) &= p_{p,x}(t_f) \\
-d + v_0\cos{\theta}t_f &= \frac{1}{6}Bt_f^3 \\
B &=  6(\frac{v_0\cos{\theta}}{t_f^2} - \frac{d}{t_f^3}) \\
B &= \frac{3g^2\cos{\theta}}{2v_0\sin^2{\theta}} - \frac{3dg^3}{4v_0^3\sin^3{\theta}}

\end{aligned}
$$


## Problem 5: Vertical Collision
We can derive the kinematic equations for both cans, which are identical. The collision occurs at $t_f$ seconds, when the height of the first is equal to the height of the second.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a(t) &= -g \\
v(t) &= v_0 - gt \\
h(t) &= v_0t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### (a) Finding $t_f$
The height of the second can is $h(t_f-t_1)$, which is equal to the height of the first $h(t_f).
$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t_f) &= h(t_f-t_1) \\
v_0t_f - \frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 &= v_0(t_f-t_1) - \frac{1}{2}g(t_f-t_1)^2 \\
v_0 &= gt_f-\frac{1}{2}gt_1
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, we know $h(t_f) = h$, so plugging in $v_0$ and solving for $t_f$ gives us the time at which the cans collide:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t_f) &= h \\
v_0t_f - \frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 &= h \\
(gt_f-\frac{1}{2}gt_1)t_f - \frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 &= h \\
\frac{1}{2}gt_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}gt_1t_f - h &= 0 \\
gt_f^2 - gt_1t_f - 2h &= 0 \\
t_f &= \frac{gt_1 \pm \sqrt{g^2t_1^2 + 8gh}}{2g} \\
t_f &= \frac{9.81(4.0) \pm \sqrt{(9.81^24.0^2+8(9.81)(5.0))}}{2(9.81)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

.

This gives us $t_f=4.2404$ seconds ([link to calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28gt_1%2Bsqrt%28g%5E2t_1%5E2%2B8gh%29%29%2F%282g%29+where+g%3D9.81%2Ct_1%3D4.0%2Ch%3D5.0)).

### (b) Finding $v_0$
We plug $t_f$ back into the equation for $v_0$ to get the initial velocity of the cans:
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_0&=gt_f-\frac{1}{2}gt_1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which gives us $v_0=21.9783$ m/s ([link to calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=v_0%3Dg*%28t%29+-+1%2F2*g*%28t_1%29%2C+where+g%3D9.81%2C+t%3D4.2404%2C+t_1%3D4.0)).
