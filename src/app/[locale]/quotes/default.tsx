        And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was
        set, his disciples came unto him:

      <p>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>

          Blessed are the poor in spirit,
          <br />
          For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
        </div>
        <div>
          Blessed are they that mourn,
          <br />
          For they shall be comforted.
        </div>
        <div>
          Blessed are the meek,

          For they shall inherit the earth.

        <div>
          Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness,

          For they shall be filled.

          Blessed are the merciful,

        <div>
          Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake,

        <p>
          Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
          shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
          Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
          for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,
          wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but
          to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be
          hid. <br />
          Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
          candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let
          your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
          glorify your Father which is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not
          come to destroy, but to fulfil. <br />
          For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
          tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.{" "}
          <br />
          Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and
          shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
          heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
          called great in the kingdom of heaven. <br />
          For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
          righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
          into the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not
          kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a
          cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to
          his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever
          shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
          that thy brother hath ought against thee;
        </p>
        <p>
          Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be
          reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
          him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the
          judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
          thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
          commit adultery:
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
          her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:
          for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,
          and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:
          for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,
          and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her
          a writing of divorcement:
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for
          the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and
          whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou
          shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
          oaths:
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is
          God's throne:
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for
          it is the city of the great King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one
          hair white or black.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is
          more than these cometh of evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth
          for a tooth:
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite
          thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
          him have thy cloak also.
        </p>
        <p>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p>
        <p>
          Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
          turn not thou away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour,
          and hate thine enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
          good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
          you, and persecute you;
        </p>
        <p>
          That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he
          maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
          on the just and on the unjust.
        </p>
        <p>
          For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even
          the publicans the same?
        </p>
        <p>
          And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do
          not even the publicans so?
        </p>
        <p>
          Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
          perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
          otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before
          thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
          they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
          reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right
          hand doeth:
        </p>
        <p>
          That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret
          himself shall reward thee openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for
          they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the
          streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They
          have their reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast
          shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father
          which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
          they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
          things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven,
          Hallowed be thy name.
        </p>
        <p>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
        <p>Give us this day our daily bread.</p>
        <p>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>
        <p>
          And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine
          is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
          forgive you:
        </p>
        <p>
          But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
          forgive your trespasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
          countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto
          men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
        </p>
        <p>
          That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in
          secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee
          openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
          doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
        </p>
        <p>
          But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
          rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
        </p>
        <p>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
        <p>
          The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,
          thy whole body shall be full of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If
          therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
          darkness!
        </p>
        <p>
          No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
          love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
          other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall
          eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
          on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
          nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye
          not much better than they?
        </p>
        <p>
          Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
        </p>
        <p>
          And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
          how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not
          arrayed like one of these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
          and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
          you, O ye of little faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall
          we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
        </p>
        <p>
          (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly
          Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
          these things shall be added unto you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
          thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
          thereof.
        </p>
        <p>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
        <p>
          For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
          measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
          considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
        </p>
        <p>
          Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of
          thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then
          shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
          before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again
          and rend you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
          shall be opened unto you:
        </p>
        <p>
          For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and
          to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give
          him a stone?
        </p>
        <p>Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p>
        <p>
          If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
          children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good
          things to them that ask him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
          ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
          way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
          thereat:
        </p>
        <p>
          Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
          life, and few there be that find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but
          inwardly they are ravening wolves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
          figs of thistles?
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
          bringeth forth evil fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
          bring forth good fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
          into the fire.
        </p>
        <p>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</p>
        <p>
          Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
          kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
          thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
          many wonderful works?
        </p>
        <p>
          And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me,
          ye that work iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
          will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
        </p>
        <p>
          And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
          beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
          shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the
          sand:
        </p>
        <p>
          And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
          beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people
          were astonished at his doctrine:
        </p>
        <p>
          For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
