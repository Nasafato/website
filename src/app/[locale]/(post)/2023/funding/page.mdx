# Why you should be very careful how you fund yourself

The VC game can kill you before you even start.

But VC funding can also be the nitrous oxide to your 500 horsepower engine.

You must understand that VCs do not need you, specifically, to succeed in order to make money. They will collect their management fees regardless of whether you, the founder, ever experience a liquidity event. They could have sunk $10 million into your company, and while they'll have collected a couple hundred thousand in efes just from that, another couple hundred thousand from another investment, and so on and so forth across all their investments, none of their investments need to pan out in the end for them to make a bunch of money.

A seed stage investor is spraying their whole fund across a hundred lottery tickets. But you are not a lottery ticket.

That is the crux of VC fundingâ€”that incentives are aligned, yes, but only to an extent. I am not saying VCs are malicious. I am saying that you should be aware of what it takes for you to come out financially ahead. I'd be wary of listening to those who have a vested financial interest in you starting a company preach about how you should start a company.

Alright, my argument is kind of weak.

I could definitely try to improve this.
