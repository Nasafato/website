# Learning physics as an adult

I am not an undergraduate anymore. I've worked in tech for six years at this point.

I am trying to learn physics. That alone is simple enough. But I'd like to get a Ph.D. in physics.

I'm very far away from that. But that's early, I guess, since I don't know what kind of research I'd want to do yet.

So, let's put a pause on that.

If you want to learn physics as an adult, getting a Ph.D. is not the right goal.

The right goal is to pursue your curiosity, not achieve some marker of status.

That's getting the order of things wrong.

Instead, let your curiosity guide you, and strengthen your habits of hard work and discipline and focus to go far in your curiosity.

That may naturally lead you to wanting a Ph.D., or it may lead you somewhere else.
