# Learning physics as an adult

I am not an undergraduate anymore. I've worked in tech for six years at this point. I am trying to learn physics. That alone is simple enough. But then it occurred to meâ€”what if I wanted to get a Ph.D. in physics? 

I'm very far away from that, and it's actually too early to think about, since I don't know what kind of research I'd want to do. So, let's put a pause on that.

If you want to learn physics as an adult, getting a Ph.D. is not the right goal. That's getting the order of things wrong.
The right goal is to pursue your curiosity, not achieve some marker of status. 

Instead, let your curiosity guide you, and strengthen your habits of hard work and discipline and focus to go far in your curiosity.  That may naturally lead you to wanting a Ph.D., or it may lead you somewhere else.

I'll keep this post updated as I learn more.

## Personal Background
I took AP Physics as a junior, taught by Dr. Gershman at Watchung Hills Regional High School in New Jersey.

That was pretty much the only physics class I ever took, minus a few lectures I attended of Columbia's 2801: Accelerated Introductory Physics, which I'd also tried to take as a junior, though in college this time, just for curiosity's sake. Then, I realized it was impossible to fit in its coursework with all my entrepreneurial activities, so I dropped the class.


# The map of the territory
Physics curriculums start with classical mechanics. It's classical because it is how we understood the laws of physics before quantum mechanics.
It's useful because they still explain many things that happen in the world.

MIT's [8.01SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/) is as good as any place to start.

The ideal resources are online and freely available.

PSETs are the most practical method I know to assess your understanding of a topic in physics.

I think we can combine that with telling ChatGPT to act as a physics examiner and probing your knowledge in various topics.

To brush up on my calculus, I'm going through MIT's [18.01SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/).

For trigonometry and understanding sines and cosines, which are super important and occur endlessly in physics, I've gone through [Trig Without Tears](https://brownmath.com/twt/intro.htm), where you learn how to derive the trigonometric functions from first principles.

I'll post the PSETs as I do them, and I'll steadily organize this page as I learn more.


- Here's an interesting video called the [Map of Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo). Gravity being the bending of spacetime to make objects fall towards each other is an insane concept. How can that be? Crazy.
- Here's a famous lecture by Walter Lewin called [For the Love of PHysics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJG-rXBbmCc).


## Kinematics and Dynamics
Kinematics is how study move. Knowing the state of the system, and most importantly, position, velocity, and acceleration, how is the system going to turn out as you move time forward?

Dynamics is why things move the way they do. This is where Newton's laws come in to tell us how forces affect the motion of objects.

## More to come
I'll insert my summary of classical mechanics at some point here.
