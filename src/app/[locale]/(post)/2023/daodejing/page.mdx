# Building the Daodejing app

I've been trying to memorize the Daodejing in its original Chinese for the past couple months. I'm currently on verse 32.

To help me do this, I built an offline-first web app at [daodejing.app](https://daodejing.app/en/verses/chinese). Apps like this should work when going through subway tunnels, in the elevator, or on a planeâ€” anywhere and anytime the WiFi is spotty or non-existent. It shouldn't need to be installed. It should work on any device, regardless of operating system. It should be fast, and it should be free.

The browser offers a lot. Write once, run anywhere. That's why we still put up with compiling TypeScript to JavaScript, why there's a profusion of JavaScript bundling solutions, why there is constant change in the ecosystem of web-based technologies. There is no runtime more ubiquitous than the modern browser.

Now, that's true mostly within a country, because most websites, in the United States at least, only have English language options. Internationalization is an after-thought, or a never-thought, because most companies don't ever need to venture beyond the borders of the English-speaking world to find a rich-enough market for what they're selling.

U.S. hegemony means international trade relies on English, and programmers of all ilk end up learning at least a little bit of English, if only so they can access the latest documentation on the cutting edge.

So, if you're a VC-backed startup trying to find product market fit in the United States, or among English-speaking users, you can get away with a monolingual app.
