If you already know the story of Cain and Abel, skip this excerpt. Otherwise, read on.

“The dust is warm,” said Samuel. “Now it goes this way. 'And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man from the Lord.” '”

...

“ 'And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.' ”

...

Samuel read, “ 'And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”

“ 'And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, “Where is Abel thy brother?”

And he said, “I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?”

And he said, “What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.”

And Cain said unto the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me.”

And the Lord said unto him, “Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.' ”

Samuel closed the loose cover of the book almost with weariness. “There it is,” he said. “Sixteen verses, no more. And oh, Lord! I had forgotten how dreadful it is—no single tone of encouragement. Maybe Liza's right. There's nothing to understand.”

—Steinbeck, John. East of Eden (pp. 265-266). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

This is an old story, and it talks about something very important, something fundamentally human: choice. Choice sets us apart as a species. And now as the year closes — a great and triumphant but also sad and difficult year — it's become clear this power of choice is the most important thing we have. Being able to make the right choice, the hard choice, and knowing how to work with ourselves so we can more often make these kinds of choices — this is the most important thing we can do. This power of choice is our weapon against nihilism and the ground beneath our feet in the face of suffering and guilt. It gives us the opportunity to redeem ourselves even when we use it to harm others and do bad things. It's our torch in the darkness, and embracing it lights the path to a good, meaningful life.

A year is a long time, because a hell of a lot can happen in those three hundred sixty five days. I thought it was going one way for 90 percent of it. I've spent most of my first full year in San Francisco building out my life — I've changed jobs, skied in Tahoe, stuffed myself with Korean food in LA, hiked in Marin, dealt with the housing market, grown in a million different ways, and made so many new friends my head spins. That was 90 percent of it.

This December, though, wasn't something I saw coming. The details I won't go into here; if you're curious, ask me directly. But this month was painful. The most painful month I've ever experienced, painful enough I've drawn a line between pre-December Alan and post-December Alan. Before, I didn't even know it was possible to hurt so badly and to feel so much guilt. I've gained a new respect for the human condition. We're capable of suffering. A lot.

Pain is an evolutionary response with two purposes: first is motivating us to get the hell away from what's causing it — if that's even possible. Second is letting us know there's something wrong.  Maybe there's something we did wrong, or maybe our behavior led to this, or maybe it was our attitude and attachment. Whatever it was, pain humbles us by burning away our arrogance. It's not something we can rationalize away. And by doing so, pain gives us an opportunity to reflect with clear eyes, so we can recreate ourselves, even just a little bit, to avoid the same pain in the future.

Of course, this reflection and recreation is a choice. This piece is my attempt at making that choice.

Looking back, both at this year and all the years before it, it becomes obvious how afraid I've been at so many times in my life. And I've done dishonorable things. Cowardly things. Sinful things. I've suffered for them, just as others have suffered because of them. I've done some good things, sure, but not enough. The real question is — how do I do less of the bad things and more of the good things? And when I inevitably still do the bad things — we're only human, so we're going to screw up not just once, or twice, or ten times, but over and over and over again — how do I keep doing the good things? And when suffering arrives, because it always does, because the world is hard and humans are fragile and weak, how do I face it?

These questions are posed by the story of Cain and Abel. We've been trying to answer them since we first gained consciousness, so let's dig in — back to East of Eden.

The storytelling we started with takes place when Samuel Hamilton, Adam Trask, and Lee gather to name Adam's twin boys, who have just been born.

After telling the story, they try to make sense of it, because Samuel is right — it's not an encouraging or hopeful story at all:

Adam said, “I remember being a little outraged at God. Both Cain and Abel gave what they had, and God accepted Abel and rejected Cain. I never thought that was a just thing. I never understood it. Do you?”

...

Adam was excited. “Yes, but why did God condemn Cain? That's an injustice.”

Samuel said, “There's an advantage to listening to the words. God did not condemn Cain at all. Even God can have a preference, can't he? Let's suppose God liked lamb better than vegetables. I think I do myself. Cain brought him a bunch of carrots maybe. And God said, 'I don't like this. Try again. Bring me something I like and I'll set you up alongside your brother.' But Cain got mad. His feelings were hurt. And when a man's feelings are hurt he wants to strike at something, and Abel was in the way of his anger.”

—Steinbeck, John. East of Eden (p. 267). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

They, and we, are wrestling with something important. What did God's rejection mean?

I'll give another interpretation I read a week ago, by this professor of psychology at the University of Toronto.

In this reading, God represents Nature, the unknown future. The sacrifices Cain and Abel prepare represent the human ability to plan far in advance, giving up something now in return for something better later. God rejects Cain, but He gives him the opportunity to try again. Instead of trying again, though, Cain becomes bitter and angry and, to spite God, murders Abel in the field. He chooses to be angry at Nature itself and strike at it.

The details of the story itself are bare, but that's the nature of these old stories — three thousand years of retelling burns every ounce of fat off them. Every Chekov's gun is fired. The details absent from the story matter just as much as the ones in it. This is why we never learn anything about why exactly God rejected Cain's sacrifice — maybe, as Samuel suggested, He likes lamb better. Maybe Cain was rushed that day and forgot to bring the cobs of corn God finds really yummy. In the end, it doesn't matter, because the world doesn't need reasons to reject us.

In Cain and Abel we see humans trying to eke out a living in this world, planting seeds now in the hopes of harvesting them at some future date. But we are fragile, easily killed, easily injured — sometimes, we try our best and Nature doesn't give a damn. Suffering comes despite all our best intentions and efforts. This is the world Cain lives in when he's faced with the choice. And we live in the same world.

My friend texted me on Christmas Eve. Her roommate had an upcoming trip to China, where she'd get maybe her last chance ever to see her grandparents. They had been talking about it, and she wondered what I'd do to prepare for a trip like this.

The question shocked me when I thought about it. Because I had not thought about it in a long time; when buying tickets to visit my mom in Dallas for Christmas, I didn't wonder "What if this is the last time I see her?" She's still in her prime. But life is unknowable — we can make the best possible preparations for the future and still get thrown a grenade in return, because even with our medicine and science and technology there are still so many things beyond our control. There are no guarantees, not for anyone, not for our grandparents we see maybe once or twice a year, or for our friends and coworkers we see every day. Our friend can get into a car accident. Our child can be born with an incurable disease which kills her before the new year. Our lives can be upended by flood, earthquake, or invasion. And these all lead to suffering and pain.

For a while, it wasn't clear to me how to reconcile the suffering we experience and the suffering we cause. One is not always deserved and the other is our own fault. It seemed we had one kind of choice to make when we experience unjust suffering and another kind when we cause suffering. But it turns out they are the same. Cain experienced suffering when God rejected his sacrifice. And his anger and jealousy which drove him to murder Abel caused yet more suffering, both for Abel and for himself.

When we experience suffering, whether we caused it ourselves or not, the choices we have are the same. If there's something we can do to stop it, then we can choose to do so. If not, we still have another  choice — we can choose to keep on trying and not give in to anger or despair. Steinbeck saw the power in this.

In East of Eden, Lee and Samuel revisit their initial discussion of the story of Cain and Abel ten years later. With the help of his elders in San Francisco's Chinatown, Lee has learned enough Hebrew to read the story in its original form, and he comes back with a new understanding of human choice.

The line under translation he references is right after God rejects Cain's sacrifice: "And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.” "

Lee's hand shook as he filled the delicate cups. He drank his down in one gulp. “Don't you see?” he cried. “The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in 'Thou shalt,' meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel—'Thou mayest'—that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if 'Thou mayest'—it is also true that 'Thou mayest not.' Don't you see?”

“Yes, I see. I do see. But you do not believe this is divine law. Why do you feel its importance?”

“Ah!” said Lee. “I've wanted to tell you this for a long time. I even anticipated your questions and I am well prepared. Any writing which has influenced the thinking and the lives of innumerable people is important. Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order, 'Do thou,' and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who feel predestination in 'Thou shalt.' Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But 'Thou mayest'! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.” Lee's voice was a chant of triumph.

—Steinbeck, John. East of Eden (pp. 301-302). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

We all experience doubt and anxiety and fears, anger and jealousy. Those emotions drive us to make certain choices: we ignore our friend's cry for help because we're annoyed, push off a conversation because it makes us afraid, insult someone in retaliation or out of spite, or, yes, even murder our brother. The consequences are pain and guilt. This is suffering. And the suffering we experience today, due to ourselves or due to fate, make us experience future doubt and anger and fear. Suffering feeds on the emotions we feel, and the emotions we feel are in a response to past sufferings. It's a cycle. To break it, we must learn to make the right choice — to "fight it through and win".

For me, the fear which made me act so badly this year had its roots all the way in my childhood. My parents' marriage was never happy, but in high school the whole structure came crashing down and my brother and I witnessed our mom's near disintegration. Every night we'd hear her crying. When we were with her, we'd hear a torrent of accusations at our dad, which hurt us more than they could have hurt him. The worst was the helplessness — seeing your first pillar of unconditional love in the world crumble and not knowing how to build it back up again.

My memories from this time formed a swamp I didn't know how to cross. When I'd see my mom or my dad or my brother, it would show up as this black pit of resentment and bitterness and sadness I nursed but had no idea how to get rid of. I suffered from it in ways I couldn't see, or wasn't willing to see — I'd convinced myself a long time ago, after college, that I was fine despite it, even though my actions and thoughts bled through the covers and showed how I still thought of myself as this damaged individual who would always be denied certain things. It's why reading A Little Life sounded out such a drumbeat in my head — Jude was just my own fears taken to their most extreme.

It was a thing I never talked about with my family. But this December, I called my mom, and had a conversation I'd been putting off for eight years. I told her about what I was going through, and how it was my fault, and how it was because of my fear. I told her about how afraid I was, how afraid I'd always been, because my worst nightmare has always been a reenactment of those high school years — witnessing the pain I saw in her borne out in someone else.

And my mom understood. My mom understood every word I said and all the ones I left unsaid. She told me how she had gone through eight years of healing and had finally found peace. She was with someone she loved, leading a life she loved, and she had forgiven my dad and forgiven herself, and she was sorry. Sorry how her  inherited pain had caused me and my brother so much pain.

I listened, and I felt this knot — this immense monster of a knot — loosen itself for the first time in a long time. And I was amazed. I felt so grateful this happened to me, because this had always scared me. It felt the way was open — I'd cut a path across the swamp. So, without a doubt, this was a moment above all other moments, which made this a year above all other years.

My mom is strong. She had taken responsibility and made choices back then, even in the worst of her pain. She had still chosen to get up, go to her job, come home and send my brother and me to lessons and buy groceries and cook and clean the house. She chose to take responsibility for her own sake and the sake of her two sons. She didn't choose this just once but rather chose it every single day. Some days she failed — some days the future was all too frightening and her doubts about making it through were too great, and she'd lash out at us or ball up in grief — but even when she failed, she always, always, tried again the next day.

All choices are composed of a million smaller choices. The little ones matter most, because no big choice is faced today without the scaffolding of a thousand other choices made yesterday. The murder of Abel seems like an enormous choice, so important we've told and retold its story for three thousand years. But these little choices are like snowflakes in a snowstorm — each one may make nearly no difference, but all of them summed up over the entire night will bury a city.

Cain did not just make a single decision to kill his brother. There were many opportunities along the way where he could have overcome his anger and hurt. When God gave him another chance, he could have chosen to take it. When he talked to Abel, he could have chosen to not convince him to come to the fields. When in the field, he could have chosen to hesitate and not kill him. But instead he does. And even in between all those choices, there were likely a thousand moments of doubt in which he could have chosen to confront his own emotions. But he did not. Maybe his anger overruled them. Maybe he rationalized them away, like we humans are so good at doing — he doesn't deserve it; I'm not really going to kill him but just hurt him; he had it coming to him.

In the end, he never made the choice to turn back. He was too weak, too arrogant, too far gone, and so was unable to stop himself from choosing to commit the first murder.

Now I see the thousand choices I get to make every day. I can choose to call my mom a little more often. I can choose to respond to my dad's texts with a little less resentment each time. I can choose to stop seeing myself as this damaged individual and instead take heart in my power to choose no matter what's happened and what will happen. I can choose, fight it through, and win.

If we choose badly today and cause suffering to others and ourselves, we still have the power to choose differently tomorrow. If we face suffering beyond our control, we still have the power to choose to live on in spite of it. More specifically, we can choose to live well — to not despair or become angry and bitter, but to keep on with our attempts to make life better. To help someone in need. To hold another. To extend a hand in friendship.

A good choice makes you just a little bit stronger. It lets you live with a little more dignity, and it makes the next choice easier. A bad choice does the opposite. Heaven and hell are not concrete places, but the state your soul reaches with the accumulation of good or bad choices, taken out to infinity. The line between good and evil reaches to the bottom of our being — the same person is capable of both murdering their brother and sacrificing themself for their child. According to Carl Jung, "No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell." To know good is to know how bad we can be, in all our choices.

There's a missing step, though, between recognizing the power of this choice and knowing how to help ourselves use it. We don't actually think about most choices we make. Our minds are complex. It's impossible to know how we are going to act in every situation until it arises, because there's a world of a difference between what we think we believe and what we actually believe. Our truest beliefs lie below our consciousness; they bubble up on their own through the mantle to form our everyday actions.

We might imagine the mind as an iceberg. Only a fraction of the iceberg is ever above water; the majority of it lurks below in the dark. And likewise, our minds make only a fraction of our choices using conscious thought. We know the water bill is coming so we write a check. We remember we're missing dish soap so we buy some.

Most of the time, though, our choices spring out of nowhere as if by magic. If you've ever told a dumb joke you thought would be funny but then realized how stupid it was with a bit of rational thought, you'll know what I'm talking about. There's an underwater factory producing our emotions, and our emotions produce our motivation for action. Of course, this arrangement is necessary, otherwise we'd be paralyzed by the amount of decisions we need to make every day.

We can change our hidden machinery, though. If we pay careful attention as we go about our days, we might just catch ourselves in the moment.

Maybe you hesitate to invite a friend over to meet your other friends. It could be you know they wouldn't get along. But maybe there's something else — if you look deeper, you realize you're afraid. Afraid of what? You might hesitate, but if you dig further, it's because you fear you'll be judged for bringing this friend. You're afraid of disappointing your other friends, because maybe you're insecure. Maybe you're afraid of not having friends, in a memory going back to your childhood. So you don't want to risk things like this. You're afraid if your friends meet this person, they'll stop wanting to be your friend.

But plunging below the water into the depths of your mind is hard. Who knows what monsters make their lair in the dark? We all have things and memories that scare us. We don't like admitting we're afraid. Yet, taking the dive is an important choice — you can either do it, or step back, ignore it, and find some easier rationalization. The first step in conquering our fears, though, is recognizing them.

So find something you have put off, something gnawing at you, and ask why. What's holding you back? If the task is too big and too frightening, it's okay to have a bit of sympathy for yourself. Find something smaller and see if you're willing to do that. For me, the task of healing my relationship with my family seemed so huge and intimidating I had no idea where to even begin. But now it's a smaller thing — a conversation with my brother, a conversation with my dad, one step at a time. It's still scary, but it's more manageable.

Or maybe there's nothing you can do.

Maybe you're convinced your path to happiness requires you to replace your boss. They've talked for ages about how they plan to leave within the year, but all of a sudden they decide they need to stay at their job. Who knows why. You could become bitter and angry at this obstacle to your happiness. But you also have the choice — maybe you can change yourself.

Perhaps you just want greater security and income and opportunity, and you've convinced yourself this is the only way to get that. But we are too attached to ourselves — our opinions and decisions and knowledge of our rightness. It's why the Oracle of Delphi said Socrates was the wisest man in the world — he knew he knew nothing. When the Athenians put him on trial, hoping the threat of death would drive him out of the city, his initial reaction was to comply. His friends had already prepared his escape route. But Socrates always listened to what he called his "inner daemon" — his conscience, in a sense. It told him, amazingly, he shouldn't run. He should stay. Socrates, in his wisdom, thought: maybe I should reconsider my attachment to living. I've already had a good, long life. Maybe this is the right way to go. So instead he went to trial and cemented his legacy with his final words, tearing apart the ones who wanted him dead.

Maybe the path you're climbing isn't the only way to Rome.

If we take a hard look at our lives, we might notice some things. Perhaps someone wants to be your friend and you've been pushing them away. Or someone loves you and the pressure of it scares you. Or maybe you live with this vague sense of dread, and what you fear most but don't know how to avoid is this existential vacuum you see coming. No matter. You still have the choice. You can chip away at this sorry state and take responsibility for your power and do something. Find something, someone, to care about. If not your family, then your friends. If not your friends, then a stranger. The world is full of problems, far too many to deal with all at once, but you don't need to deal with them all at once, all in one go — it's enough to deal with a little bit at a time. And you'll find as you do more, you grow strong enough to carry a heavier burden, and instead of being lost in the fog you realize you stand on the cusp of a great valley where you can see possibilities beyond your previous imagining.

There's a line by C.S Lewis: "You cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society. That is why we must go on to think of the second thing: of morality inside the individual." In our modern day, we like to think of designing a perfect system and enacting perfect laws to make the perfect place. But no matter how smart we think we are, humans will always bend a system over time. Truly making the world better requires stepping into the messiness of human morality — on teaching and learning how to make the right choice. That's how we get better. That's how the world gets better. Like Cain, we can choose to murder our brother, or we can choose to take a higher path. So, timshel, my friends. The power is in each one of us.

“Thou mayest rule over sin,' Lee. That's it. I do not believe all men are destroyed. I can name you a dozen who were not, and they are the ones the world lives by. It is true of the spirit as it is true of battles—only the winners are remembered. Surely most men are destroyed, but there are others who like pillars of fire guide frightened men through the darkness. 'Thou mayest, Thou mayest!' What glory! It is true that we are weak and sick and quarrelsome, but if that is all we ever were, we would, millenniums ago, have disappeared from the face of the earth. A few remnants of fossilized jawbone, some broken teeth in strata of limestone, would be the only mark man would have left of his existence in the world. But the choice, Lee, the choice of winning! I had never understood it or accepted it before." [Samuel Hamilton]
